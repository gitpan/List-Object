List-Object version 0.01
========================

List::Object was inspired by several other modules Array 
for having an object-oriented interface to perl's array functions. 
Class::MethodMaker for its auto-generated methods that do that 
same thing with its "object_list" functionality (hence the name 
of this package), as well as the fact that it enforces the 
declared datatype on its members. And I like the generic Iterator 
interface for woking with lists.

In a nutshell, List::Object has three main features:
* Object-oriented interface to perl's array methods
* Implements the Iterator interface for the list
* Enforces datatypes of list members.
